This is a simple script to download video from YouTube in your favorite audio format. We are using Python's third-party module "Pafy". 
You need to install Pafy module on your system in order to successfully run this script. To install Pafy see the official installation guide here:

Add YouTube's video URL and wait for the audio formats. Once the available audio formats are listed, select any of them to download.
File will be downloaded on Desktop in Linux.

This scripted is tested on Linux!
